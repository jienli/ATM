This version is based on the previous version "1 FFN" and inherits most of its functionalities. Some changes include:
1. Multiple starting points are used to complete a single training session for improved accuracy (NUM_OF_STARTING_POINTS) (although more lengthy)


Parameters that are subject to change/adjustment are listed in module "Constants.py"

Can manually change the min-max setting in the module "Data_Arrangement" by toggle comments. (Entire history min-max usually produce better results)
